/**
Create a Dice game. The first dice game allows the player to roll two dices each time.
* 
If both dice is equal, the player can roll again. The player score each time they roll the
dices. Player that reaches 100 points or more wins the game. 
* 
* The second dice game allows the player to roll one dice each time. When the dice is 6, the player can roll
one more time. However, if the player rolls 6 again in second attempt, the player
wonâ€™t have any score. Player that reaches 100 point wins the game. 
* 
* If the player scores more than 100, the last score is not counted and the player needs to roll again
in next turn. 
* 
* Create a Tester class to test the program.
